Campus Connect is an interactive, AI-assisted user-friendly web application designed to help navigate campus buildings. The website objectives to make navigating campus more convenient, and accessible. Its primary audience includes students, particularly freshmen and transfer students, new faculty and staff members, and parents or guardians visiting. By providing clear guidance and enhancing accessibility, such as merging live location tracking, dynamic building info, and smart search tools into a seamless experience tailored to students, faculty, staff, and visitors alike that can easily discover and navigate a wide range of campus resources. 



# Technology Stack: 
## Frontend
  * React.js: Used for building the web app's user interface (UI). React's component-based structure allows us to create reusable components for the homepage, map navigation, building information, and destination pages.
  * Google Maps API: Powers the interactive map that displays campus buildings, navigation routes, and clickable markers. It also provides features like route direction and location sharing for a seamless user experience.
  * Tailwind CSS:Enables rapid UI styling with utility-first CSS classes, ensuring the app looks modern, is responsive, and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.
    
## Backend
  * Firebase Firestore:Used to store data related to campus buildings, such as names, descriptions, contact information, and office hours. Firestore's real-time syncing allows updates (e.g., parking availability or building status) to reflect instantly in the app. 
      
## Tools
  * Git/GitHub:Used for version control and collaborative development. The team tracks progress, organizes sprints, and manages codebase updates efficiently using GitHub's project boards and branching features.
  * Visual Studio Code: The primary development environment, enhanced by extensions for React, Tailwind, and Firebase to streamline the coding process.
  * Github projects:A project management tool used to divide tasks, assign roles, and ensures timely completion of sprints.
  * Google Cloud Console: Interface to manage Firebase services like Firestore, Authentication, and Hosting. Also used for API key management and monitoring analytics.
  * Git Bash: Command-line tool used to run Git commands, push/pull changes, and manage branches in Windows environments.

      
# Programming Languages:
  * JavaScript: TThe primary language used for both frontend interface logic and direct database communication. React handles the dynamic user interface, while Firebase’s JavaScript SDK allows the app to read/write Firestore data, handle authentication, and interact with AI services — all securely from the client side.


       
# How the Tools Work Together: 
## Frontend Workflow
  * React.js: React builds the app's user interface. Each page (home, navigation/building info, map, destination) is a React component. React interacts with the backend to fetch and display dynamic data, such as building descriptions and navigation routes. It handles user input (e.g., searches, button clicks) and sends requests to the backend for processing.
    
  * Google Maps API: Embedded within the React app, Google Maps provides the interactive map interface. It displays campus locations as markers, highlights routes for walking or driving, and dynamically updates navigation paths based on the user’s current location.
    
  * Tailwind CSS: Tailwind handles the app’s styling and layout. Its utility-first classes ensure the app is responsive (mobile-friendly) and visually appealing. The styling is tightly integrated with React components to ensure consistency.
      
## Backend Workflow      
  * Firebase Firestore: CampusConnect uses Firestore as a real-time NoSQL database to store data related to campus buildings, including names, descriptions, operating hours, services, and geographical coordinates. The frontend (React) communicates directly with Firestore using the Firebase SDK — no backend server is required. This allows seamless and secure data retrieval in JSON format. Firestore’s real-time syncing ensures that updates, such as changes to department hours or location info, are immediately reflected in the UI without requiring a manual page refresh.
          
  * FirestoreSearchService: handles keyword, service-based search queries, and queries sent to AI for response generation and storing response in the database.

  * Gemini AI via Firestore Extension: AI-powered answers are generated through a Firestore collection (extChatHistory) that triggers external processing via Gemini. The frontend writes a user query to the collection, and when a response is generated, it’s synced back to the app in real-time using onSnapshot() listeners.



    
# Development and Collaboration Tools: 
  ## Git/GitHub:
   * Git tracks code changes, and GitHub acts as the repository for collaboration.Team members work on different features in separate branches, merge completed work into the main branch, and resolve conflicts efficiently. The project board in GitHub organizes tasks and tracks sprint progress.
   * Git **Bash** used for local Git commands.
   * GitHub Projects organizes sprints and tasks.
  ## Visual Studio Code:
   * VS Code is the primary development environment. Developers write code, debug issues, and use extensions for React, Tailwind, and Firebase to speed up development.
  ## Lucidchart:
   * Used during the planning phase to create wireframes, database schemas, and user flow diagrams.Provides a clear blueprint for developers, reducing confusion during implementation.
  ## Google Cloud Console:
   * Generate API keys for Google Maps, monitor database access, and review analytics.

# API Documentation:

## Google Maps API:
   * In Google Cloud Console the project was opened for CampusConnect, then the API and services for the Google Maps Platform and Maps SDK for ios services were enabled. The API key for the Google Maps Platform is generated in credentials and automatically downloaded to the local device. The key was selected and web rescrictions to our ports were added for rate limit usage and unauthorized uses.
     
   * In Firebase the Firebase API is added through the SDK by installing:
     ```sh
     npm install firebase
     ```
     Afterwards, the Firebase is initialized with the SDK configurations (including the Firebase API Key) to connect our website to the firebase.


# Description of Pages:

## `/src/pages`:

### `Welcome.js`:
   * A landing page of the CampusConnect web application. It provides users with an entry point to search for buildings and services on campus efficiently. This page is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, allowing students, faculty, and visitors to quickly find important locations using the search bar or predefined recommendation buttons.
   * Features:
     - Displays a welcoming message with the application's name and purpose.
     - Connects to the search system and retrieves data from Firebase Firestore.
     - Implements real-time search functionality:
       - Queries Firestore for matching building names.
       - Displays search results in a dropdown list.
       - Redirects users to a building’s page if only one match is found.
     - Offers recommendation buttons for commonly searched places (Library, Gym, Cafe, etc.).
     - Enhances user experience with a responsive UI and smooth navigation.

### `Building.js`:
   * Dynamically renders detailed information about a selected campus building based on the URL parameter. Displays slideshow images, operating hours, services, departments, and includes Google Maps navigation with walking/driving routes from the user’s live location.
   * Features:
     - Connects with Firestore to fetch building data.
     - Uses React Router for page navigation.
     - Handles search functionality using `firestoreSearchService.js`.
     - Integrates Google Maps API for location visualization.
     
### `Contact.js`:
   * Provides users with direct communication channels for reaching the CampusConnect development team. Rather than serving general university contact info, this page is specifically designed for gathering user feedback, support requests, suggestions, or bug reports related to the app itself. It's meant to promote transparency, encourage engagement, and ensure continuous improvement of the platform based on real user input.
   * Features:

     - Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
     - Emphasizes the project's student-led and collaborative nature.
    
### `MapNavigation.js`:
   * Renders the interactive Google Maps preview for CampusConnect. It dynamically generates walking or driving directions between the user's current location and a selected building on campus, using the Google Maps Directions API. Designed for performance and user clarity, it handles map rendering, route drawing, distance/duration updates, and debounced API requests — all while visually signaling load progress to the user.
   * Features:
     - Google Maps Integration: Displays a live interactive map via Google Maps API with real-time route rendering.
     - Debounced Routing: Uses a custom-built debounce function to avoid excessive Directions API calls when inputs (like travel mode or destination) change.
     - Route Caching: Implements route caching using unique cache keys to prevent repeated API calls for the same route.
     - Dynamic Marker Placement: Adds custom markers (A for user, B for destination) using AdvancedMarkerElement when available, falling back to default markers for compatibility.
     - Auto-Resizing & Fit Bounds: Automatically adjusts map bounds to fit the full route for better mobile and desktop experience.
     - Distance & Duration Calculation: Extracts and sends distance/duration data (e.g., "0.4 mi", "5 mins") to parent components for display alongside navigation options.
     - Loading Overlay: Visually indicates route and map tile loading status before displaying the map, improving UX on slower networks.
     - Map Initialization Guarding: Ensures the map and renderer only initialize once, avoiding unnecessary rerenders.
     - Responsive Layout: Styled with Tailwind and custom CSS to fit flexibly inside containers across screen sizes.
     - Minimal External Dependencies: Purely relies on native Google Maps APIs and minimal utility functions for performance and clarity.
    
### `App.css`:
   * Contains essential map-related styles used by the MapNavigation component. It ensures that the Google Maps container occupies the full height and width of its parent while avoiding rendering issues, especially on smaller screens.
   * Features:
     - Full Map Coverage: Ensures the map fills its container using width: 100% and height: 100%.
     - Absolute Positioning: Uses position: absolute with top: 0 and left: 0 to layer the map correctly inside its wrapper.
     - Min-Height Safeguard: Applies a minimum height (400px) to prevent rendering issues where the map may appear blank due to no vertical space being allocated — especially useful for mobile views or when containers collapse.


## `/src/services`:

### `firestoreSearchService.js`:
   * Handles search functionality for the CampusConnect application. It queries the Firestore database to find buildings that match the user's search input.
   * Features:
     - Searches using three approaches:
       - **Keyword Matching**: Searches for the user's query in the "search_keywords" field of each building document.
       - **Services Offered Matching**: Searches the "services_offered" field if no keyword match is found.
       - **Departments/Building Available**: Searches for departments available within a building or the general name of the building. 
     - The Welcome Page (`Welcome.js`) or Building Page (`Building.js`) calls `searchBuildings(query)`.
     - The function queries Firestore:
       - First by keyword (e.g., searching "library" might match "Library", "Learning Center", etc.).
       - Then by services offered (e.g., searching "printing" finds buildings offering that service).
       - Finally by building name or department (e.g., "Sandford Hall" or "IT support" offerred in Sanford Hall). 
     - The matching buildings are returned as an array to the frontend.
     - The UI dynamically displays matching results to the user.
     - Users can click on a result to navigate to a building’s detailed page (`Building.js`).

### `firestoreService.js`:
   * Contains a function called `updateDocumentsWithId`, which updates every document in the "buildings" collection of Firestore by adding an `id` field that matches the document’s unique Firestore ID.
   * Features:
     - Retrieves all documents from the "buildings" collection.
     - Creates a Firestore batch operation to improve performance by committing multiple updates at once.
     - Iterates through each document in the collection:
       - Generates a reference to that document.
       - Updates the document to include an "id" field with the document’s Firestore ID.
     - Commits the batch operation, applying all updates efficiently in one transaction.
     - Logs a confirmation message once all documents are updated.

## `/src`:

### `App.js`:
   * Entry point of the CampusConnect application.
   * Features:
     - Sets up React Router to enable smooth navigation between pages without reloading.
     - Defines routes for different pages:
       - Welcome Page (`/`) → Main landing page for searching buildings.
       - Building Page (`/building/:id`) → Displays detailed building information.
       - NotFound Page (`*`) → Handles unmatched routes (404 page).
     - Tests Firestore Connection when the app starts to ensure the database is accessible.
     - Applies a Global Background Style to maintain UI consistency.

### `Index.js`:
   * The entry point for rendering the CampusConnect React application.
   * Features:
     - Initializes the React app using `ReactDOM.createRoot()` for React 18+ compatibility.
     - Renders the `App` component inside the `<div id="root">` in `index.html`.
     - Uses `React.StrictMode` to detect potential issues and ensure best practices in development mode.

### `Index.html`:
   * The core HTML structure for the CampusConnect web application.
   * Features:
     - Provides a container (`<div id="root">`) where the React app is rendered.
     - Sets up metadata (`<meta>` tags) for character encoding and responsive design.
     - Loads Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling.
     - Defines a custom Tailwind theme with navy and gold brand colors.
     - Applies a global background (`bg-navy text-white`) to maintain consistent UI styling.
